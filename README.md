# Mean_teacher_FashionMNIST
Implementation of Mean Teacher Semi-Supervised training for classification of MNIST Data

Launch the num_5_v4.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to get the final implementation. Hyperparameters have been defined in the "args" class. 
num_1 to num_4 showcase my code while using Pytorch for the First time. 

The other notebooks with the name num_5*.ipynb are riddled with bugs, all of which I solved in v4. Do take a look if you want to learn from my mistakes.

Cheers!
