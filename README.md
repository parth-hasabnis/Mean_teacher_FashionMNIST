# Mean_teacher_FashionMNIST
Implementation of Mean Teacher Semi-Supervised training for classification of MNIST Data

Launch the num_5_v4.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to get the final implementation. Hyperparameters have been defined in the "args" class. 
You will need the usual Python Data science libraries, and PyTorch. The code is written for the cpu version, but adding cuda support should not be terribly difficult. 
num_1 to num_4 showcase my code while using Pytorch for the First time. 

The other notebooks with the name num_5*.ipynb are riddled with bugs, all of which I solved in v4. Do take a look if you want to learn from my mistakes.

Cheers!
